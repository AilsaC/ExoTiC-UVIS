    "ExoTiC-UVIS operates using configuration files, designated with the .hustle file extension. Each .hustle file controls one Stage of ExoTiC-UVIS. .hustle files are more human-readable that raw code and they allow you to easily reproduce previous runs of ExoTiC-UVIS as well as rapidly sharing your reduction and analysis methods with your colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to make our Stage 0 .hustle file. The next cell contains a template stage_0.hustle file which you can modify to run Stage 0 of ExoTiC-UVIS. We're going to modify it so that it downloads the HUSTLE program observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-127b. To make it do this, make the following changes to the .hustle file template:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define 'toplevel_dir' to be a local path with a recognizable name, like 'WASP-127b_analysis'.\n",
    "2. Set the verbose, show_plots, and save_plots variables to each be 0, 1, or 2. verbose controls how many printed statements the pipeline produces, letting you keep track of what the pipeline is doing and what step it is on. show_plots allows the pipeline to temporarily pause execution to show you an interactive plot. save_plots saves output .png or .gif files for plots and other graphics produced. 0 prints/shows/saves nothing, while 2 prints/shows/saves everything.\n",
    "3. Set do_download to True, since we are downloading files. If you have already been given data, such as from a collaborator through Box or Drive, you would set do_download to False and point ExoTiC-UVIS to your data folder with the filesfrom_dir variable.\n",
    "4. Set programID to the string '17183' and target name to the string 'WASP-127'.\n",
    "5. Set the extensions variable. If you want to download all available data, set this value to None. You really only need the _flt and _spt .fits files from MAST, so you can filter out all other files by setting this variable to the list ['_flt.fits','_spt.fits'] to only select these file extensions.\n",
    "6. Set do_organize to True. This variable allows you to sort files into useful directories and assigns more readable filenames to each file. Unless you have pre-downloaded data that has already been sorted (e.g. direct images separated from spectroscopic images), I would recommend always running this step.\n",
    "7. Set visit_number to the string '12', since WASP-127b was visit 12 in this program.\n",
    "8. Set do_locate to True and location to None. When do_locate is True, ExoTiC-UVIS will execute a step that requires your interaction. It will show you an interactive plot of the direct image. Use this interactive plot to locate the target star's x and y coordinates, getting as close to the centroid as you can. The target star is usually the brightest star in the frame and tends to be found near x = 970, y = 170. Once you close the plot, ExoTiC-UVIS will ask you to supply the x, y coordinates of the target star, and then will provide you with possible more precise locations of the source. Select the x, y coordinates closest to those you found while examining the interactive plot.\n",
    "9. Set do_quicklook to True and gif_dir to 'quicklook'. This prompts ExoTiC-UVIS to create a simple .gif showing you the data you downloaded, which can be helpful in determining whether the data needs to be re-taken.\n",
    "\n",
    " As you modify each variable, take a moment to read the comment to its right. These comments tell you what each variable does and what else you can do with them."
