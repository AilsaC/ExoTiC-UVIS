# ExoTiC-UVIS
Pipeline development for analysis of Hubble Space Telescope WFC3-UVIS G280 spectroscopic observations.

This package combines the pipelines ``Hazelnut`` ([@AbbyBoehm](https://github.com/AbbyBoehm)) and ``lluvia`` ([@CarlosGascon](https://github.com/CarlosGascon)) outlined in Boehm et al. (2024, AJ) and includes steps to download the raw and processed Hubble UVIS data from the MAST archive.
